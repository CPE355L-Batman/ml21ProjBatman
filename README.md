###### Phase 1 Project Title: 

# Color Reflex Game

##Team Members/ Positions:

Paul Vincent B. Espina (Researcher)

Maria Pamela P. Tagayon (Leader)


###### Brief Description: 

The Color Reflex Game would be a simple game where a player is tasked to match the right button with what color name is displayed. The colors would be limited to red, green, and blue, it would light up once the name of the color would be shown on the screen. The window to press the button would vary depending on what we deem is achievable by a human’s reflexes. As of now we envision it as 10 attempts, tallying the scores if the button was pushed on time or not and also getting the average reaction time of the player. The idea of opening a different LED from the color name display to give a challenge to the player is also tackled by the group and is in consideration.
