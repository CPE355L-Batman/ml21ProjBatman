###### Project Description: 

The Color Reflex Game is a fun and challenging game good for all ages. A player will start the game by selecting the push button. Afterwards, the LCD will display
random LED color where in we limited it by three colors: red, green, and blue. Therefore, the player is tasked to push the right button. 
When a player select a wrong button the game will still continue. When the game ends, the LCD will display the tally of the scores if the button was pushed on time or not and also getting the average reaction time of the player
 

###### Phase 2: Project Specifications
 
**Feature Set:**
- LEDS (in various colors, 3)

     LED are used as an indicator in this game. 

- LCD Display (1)

     The LCD Display will show a random 3 colors: Blue, Red, and Green. It will also show the tally of the score and the average reaction time of the player at the end. 

- Push Button (3)

     The Push Button acts as the activator in this game. Each Buttons are added near the each LED’s indicating the association between them. When a player push the right button they will score a point.
