# Color Reflex Game
A game that would test the reaction time of the player by hitting the right button based on the color shown on the display. 
The lcd display shows a color that the player should click. The challenge in this game is that when the LED lights up it shows another color, which then
the player must push the right button and it will automatically be registered(or recorded) and will be displayed on the lcd display.
if the player push the wrong button then the same will happen.
