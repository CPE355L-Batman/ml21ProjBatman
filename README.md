# Color Reflex Game

###### Brief Description: 

The Color Reflex Game would be a simple game where a player is tasked to match the right button with what color name is displayed. The colors would be limited to red, green, and blue, it would light up once the name of the color would be shown on the screen. The window to press the button would vary depending on what we deem is achievable by a human’s reflexes. As of now we envision it as 10 attempts, tallying the scores if the button was pushed on time or not and also getting the average reaction time of the player. The idea of opening a different LED from the color name display to give a challenge to the player is also tackled by the group and is in consideration.

###### Phase 2: Project Specifications
 
The Color Reflex Game is a fun and challenging game good for all ages. This game is not only for fun but it also helps to determine how quick the player's reaction and reflex is. Since this game is a bit more complex than a normal Reaction and Reflex Game,which is a combination of both, it will be a good entertainment of a person's spare time.

### Feature Set:

- LEDS (in various colors, 3)

     LED are used as an indicator in this game. A random LED will act as a distraction as it blink the wrong color contrary to the color written in the LCD display.

- LCD Display (1)

     The LCD Display will show a random 3 colors: Blue, Red, and Green. It will also show the tally of the score and the average reaction time of the player at the end. 

- Push Button (3)

     The Push Button acts as the activator in this game. Each Buttons are added near the each LED’s indicating the association between them. When a player push the right button they will score a point.

- Arduino (1) 

- Resistor 220 ohms (3)
