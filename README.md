# Color Reflex Game
A game that would test the reaction time of the player by hitting the right button based on the color shown on the display. 
The LCD display shows a color that the player should click. The challenge in this game is that the LCD display will show the word of the color and at the same time, random LED lights will flicker, showing the correct color or a wrong one. 
The player must then push the right button as quickly as they can and it will automatically register on the system. After 30 seconds, the number of correct clicks and the average time of the user will be displayed on the LCD display.
